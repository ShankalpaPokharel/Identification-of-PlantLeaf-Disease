# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) repository! This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for detecting plant diseases through image analysis using deep learning techniques.

## About

This repository contains the source code and resources for building a plant disease detection system. The system leverages the power of CNNs to analyze images of plant leaves and accurately identify various diseases. By automating disease detection, this project contributes to more efficient and effective crop management in agriculture.
